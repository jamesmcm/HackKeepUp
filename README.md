# HackKeepUp

KeepUp game implemented in the Hack language for Nand2Tetris

--------------------------------------------------------------------

The aim of the game is to keep the ball bouncing by moving the paddle below it.
The paddle is controlled by the arrow keys, A and D, or H and L (vi-style).
The game can be reset by pressing R, paused by pressing P and terminated by pressing Q.
If you die, restart by pressing R. 
Your current score and best score so far are shown at the bottom of the screen.

If you get the Segment Space error, try to clear the RAM and reload the program, 
or restart the VM emulator and reload it.

Hit the ball from the opposing side to slow it down. Hitting it towards the side it is travelling will speed it up.
But if you stop the ball moving horizontally completely, it will speed up with the next hit!
